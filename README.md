## Drawing is hard.
It's okay. You might not be able to draw. You might not be an artist. However, with arter, you can scribble, and become an **arter**.
Arter takes in the user input - a prompt - and some scribbles. It then uses artificial intelligence to bring that scribble into reality. 
Test it for yourself now.

## NOTE
I'm using Replicate.com's free scribble API - https://replicate.com/jagilley/controlnet-scribble.

The free version is very limited, so the image generation might not load sometimes due to HTTP error 402. 
If the image generation is not working, send me a message.
